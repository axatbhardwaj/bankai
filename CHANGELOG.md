# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Keep pre-created peer-review angle checkouts under the reviewed repository's
  existing Paseo project by requiring explicit project registration and
  workspace-ID launches at the point of dispatch.

## 11.8.2 - 2026-09-11

- Retire the separate Astra advisor profile; keep the selected model as driver
  and Fable as general planning/design advisor. Preserve human escalation and
  independent review.
- Add an independent Opus-high Complexity and Simplicity angle to peer PR
  reviews, and apply its shared checklist inside the existing Opus
  implementation checkpoint without adding another checkpoint agent.
- Replace active Grok workflow routes with renamed Claude Opus 5 research,
  correctness, monitor, and watchdog profiles while preserving generic Grok
  provider support and safely retiring superseded managed profile IDs.

## 11.8.1 - 2026-09-11

- Make the main conversation's selected model the workflow driver, use Fable
  before substantial planning, and add a high-effort Astra technical advisor
  before consequential design without changing the independent Opus review or
  human publication gates.
- Preserve the existing Astra-then-Fable consensus requirement for new
  high-stakes decisions, including explicit verdicts against the same evidence,
  while keeping routine work proportional and advisor sessions reusable.

## 11.8.0 - 2026-09-11

- Add a Debian-only Hermes relay setup mode and default post-Paseo-profile step,
  with an immutable Hermes bootstrap pin and immutable public relay source at
  `paseo-hermes-relay` v0.2.0 commit
  `73846214657a165379a1698b6bccff6c9c9e484f`, generic and PR transport modes,
  verified offline-source override, private configuration preservation, and
  receipt-backed activation with marker revocation on incomplete attempts.
- Require a successful per-host enable marker before bundled PR workflows make
  any Hermes relay or remote transport call; PR mode retains its live GitHub
  guard, generic receipts are opt-in delivery only, and local/Arch workflows
  remain local.
- Remove the transitional vendored relay and its duplicate Haoshoku Python test
  suite now that the standalone release and CI are authoritative.

## 11.7.7 - 2026-09-10

- Give Fable explicit early planning triggers for ambiguous requirements, design
  tradeoffs, conflicting research and repeated failed fixes, with bounded
  planning outputs and session reuse. Preserve proportional routine work and
  the existing high-stakes consensus and independent review gates.

- Cap submitted PR review bodies at 7500 characters alongside the existing
  399-line limit, directing reviewers to tighten prose rather than drop
  findings when a review runs long.

- Keep PR review and babysitting workspaces under the repository’s existing Paseo
  project. Require explicit project ownership and verify workspace placement
  before launching workers, preventing temporary role checkouts from becoming
  separate sidebar projects.

- Add validated `~/.config/haoshoku/paseo-tasks.json` defaults and CLI controls
  for future Paseo task metadata and archive-or-keep cleanup policy, preserving
  custom fields and leaving invalid config untouched.
- Add a bundled model-routing lifecycle convention for unique per-run task
  labels, readable role names, explicit parentage-checked rosters, recorded
  completion evidence, and preferred no-force archival with its non-atomic
  preflight limitation documented. This adds no timer, chat migration,
  workspace deletion, or native Paseo UI grouping.

## 11.7.6 - 2026-09-09

- Use Sol at high effort for Visual Review while preserving the existing profile ID and review responsibilities.

## 11.7.5 - 2026-09-09

- Replace the owned HTML-deliverables workflow with the pinned upstream
  visual-explainer skill, keeping ordinary prose in its requested format and
  retaining proportional source and visual review through existing profiles.
- Add a persisted `dark`, `light`, or `system` explainer theme preference with
  dark as the default, and archive the retired live skill before removing only
  its managed Claude/Codex links.
- Give every bundled Paseo profile a readable display name while preserving its
  stable internal ID and runtime configuration.

## 11.7.4 - 2026-09-09

- Remove OpenCode from managed workflow routes. Keep documentation,
  correctness, and requirements on Claude Opus 5 at medium effort; use
  provider-native Grok 4.6 for separate recurring monitor and watchdog
  sessions whose healthy heartbeats remain snapshot-only.

## 11.7.3 - 2026-09-09

- Route substantial research through Opus at high effort and explanatory HTML
  presentation through a separate Opus profile at medium, while raising Opus
  content review and Sonnet exploration to their intended efforts. Upgrades
  retire the two superseded Sonnet profile IDs only when their replacements are
  bundled.
- Expand high-effort Fable from planning into evidence-backed consensus with
  Astra for new high-stakes decisions, with bounded reconciliation, explicit
  escalation, and independent Opus candidate review preserved.

## 11.7.2 - 2026-09-08

- Replace the three managed Muse Spark Free documentation, PR requirements,
  and PR monitoring profiles with GLM 5.3 Flash, including bundled workflow
  references and conditional cleanup of the retired managed profile IDs.

## 11.7.1 - 2026-09-08

- Sync the bundled `paseo-pr-review` skill so peer PR reviews submit the
  consolidated verdict automatically, while preserving report-only overrides,
  separate merge authorization, and exact-head receipt validation.

## 11.7.0 - 2026-09-08

- Make Paseo the default orchestrator: install `paseo-bin` on Arch, launch the
  desktop by its absolute AUR path, require the native daemon on Debian, and
  keep T3 Code as an optional compatibility service.
- Install upstream Paseo orchestration skills and sync the Haoshoku-owned
  routing, review, and HTML-deliverable skills for Claude Code and Codex.
- Add whitelist-only Paseo profile/provider policy sync and backup while
  preserving credentials, network settings, unknown profiles, and unrelated
  configuration.
- Make shared agent instructions portable and document local, SSH-host, and
  optional encrypted-relay operation across PC and VPS hosts.

## 11.6.1 - 2026-09-08

- Support direct root ownership for `--server-paseo`, including root's systemd
  user manager and UID 0 daemon status.
- Run the NodeSource and Node.js installation steps without `sudo` when already
  root, while preserving the existing non-root setup path.

## 11.6.0 - 2026-09-08

- Add `--server-paseo` and an optional Debian setup step for a native headless
  Paseo daemon with a persistent systemd user service and optional relay pairing.
- Preserve existing Paseo configuration, default fresh installs to localhost,
  refuse unmanaged daemon conflicts, and restart changed managed services.
- Share the Node runtime bootstrap while preserving T3 compatibility checks.

## 11.5.1 - 2026-09-07

- Reassert `haoshoku-browser.desktop` as the XDG browser and web URL handler
  at every Omarchy login, so browser or desktop updates cannot silently bypass
  Haoshoku's most-recently-focused Brave Origin profile routing.

## 11.5.0 - 2026-09-03

- Revert the mesh-access feature set shipped in 11.3.0 and still present in
  11.4.0 (`--tailscale`, `--sshd`, `--herdr`, `configs/ssh/authorized_keys`,
  per-host mesh users). T3 Code is the phone path again: the Debian T3 server
  step is mandatory as before, `t3code-bin` is back in the Arch package list,
  and the Debian path keeps its original public-SSH policy.

## 11.4.0 - 2026-09-03

- Give each mesh host its own login user in the managed `~/.ssh/config` block
  (`xzat` for `pc`/`laptop`, `root` for `vps`) instead of the local username,
  so cross-machine SSH works when usernames differ.

## 11.3.0 - 2026-09-03

- Add `--tailscale`: install Tailscale, enable `tailscaled`, and join the
  tailnet with an interactive login only when the node is not already
  Running. Runs on both the Arch and Debian paths.
- Add `--sshd`: key-only sshd drop-in, per-machine ed25519 key, union merge of
  `configs/ssh/authorized_keys` into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, managed
  `pc`/`laptop`/`vps` block in `~/.ssh/config`, and UFW SSH restricted to
  `tailscale0`. On Debian the public SSH rule is removed only behind a lockout
  gate (Tailscale Running + keys present) and a confirmation prompt. This
  reverses the old Debian "keep password login" policy and supersedes its
  `setupSsh` step.
- Add `--herdr`: install herdr as the agent session layer when missing, pin the
  stable channel, and enable systemd lingering. Never upgrades an existing
  install.
- Make the Debian T3 Code server step opt-in (default no); a skipped T3 no
  longer fails the run. Drop `t3code-bin` from the Arch package list.
  `--server-t3-code` is unchanged.

## 11.2.8 - 2026-09-03

- Recover `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` in the default-browser router when
  xdg-open callers spawn outside the compositor session (portals, systemd
  units, remote shells), so links keep opening in the most recently focused
  Brave Origin profile instead of silently falling back to the default one.

## 11.2.7 - 2026-09-02

- Install Omakade from the Arch application list. Steam and Omakade now start
  silently on gaming workspace 2 at login, and `SUPER+2` focuses that workspace
  and launches Omakade when it is missing. `SUPER+SHIFT+G` still toggles the
  workspace and ensures Steam. Steam's overlay window rule tiles the client so
  Omarchy's stock `float = true` does not reopen it as a centered float.

## 11.2.6 - 2026-09-02

- Add a non-locking KDE Connect `Screens Off` command for paired phones. The
  command turns off all Hyprland displays through DPMS, preserves existing
  remote commands, and is available through `--kde-connect-commands` as well
  as the full Omarchy setup.

## 11.2.5 - 2026-09-01

- Pin Elysian to size-24 / 4-pass blur, 0.80 window glass, and 0.90 browser
  opacity. Copy the theme's Omarchy 4 `hyprland.lua.tpl` into the user themed
  overlay so cloned-theme Lua dropping does not skip the glass, and keep
  Kitty background opacity in the base config.

## 11.2.4 - 2026-08-31

- Authenticate sudo once before the Arch setup, keep its timestamp alive with
  silent, non-interactive refreshes while setup runs, keep all later Haoshoku
  sudo calls non-interactive, and always stop the refresh timer when setup
  completes or aborts.

## 11.2.3 - 2026-08-30

- Route the Arch setup's full system upgrade through `omarchy update -y` when
  Omarchy is installed, preserving Omarchy's snapshots, migrations, hooks, and
  restart checks instead of triggering its direct-Pacman transaction guard.

## 11.2.2 - 2026-08-30

- Start T3 Code once at Omarchy login from both device workspace overlays.
  Leave it on whichever workspace it opens or is moved to, and make `Super+T`
  focus the existing window instead of forcing workspace 1.
- Remove the Haoshoku `Super+A` Haki binding, and make `Super+M` reveal the
  `special:music` workspace on the currently focused monitor.

## 11.2.1 - 2026-08-26

- Pin Elysian to its Omarchy 4-compatible v1.0.0 release. Recognized legacy
  local-origin checkouts are moved to a timestamped sibling backup before the
  clean pinned theme is installed; failed installs restore the original
  checkout, and unrelated theme directories remain untouched.

## 11.2.0 - 2026-08-25

- Automatically detect fresh Arch installations as PC or laptop from DMI
  chassis data, falling back to battery presence when DMI is inconclusive.
  Persist the result before device-routed setup, honor an existing explicit
  selection, and keep `--device-type` as the manual override.
- Add a portable Omarchy appearance manifest and `--omarchy-appearance` mode.
  Full Arch setup safely installs Elysian at its pinned commit and asks Omarchy
  to apply the tracked background and font. Matching dirty checkouts are
  preserved; foreign theme directories are never replaced.

## 11.1.0 - 2026-08-25

- Bundle the user-owned `xzat.tray` Omarchy plugin and deploy or back it up with
  the managed bar. The overflow drawer now keeps status notifier items together
  with Galaxy Buds, hyprmoncfg, Display, and No Sleep controls while preserving
  Feishin and generic MPRIS playback on the left.
- Replace both the stock Agents widget and the former Agent Usage plugin with
  Agent Usage Plus, keeping it in the stock right-bar position and deploying
  the user-path collector wrapper required by the upstream plugin. The wrapper
  also translates Omarchy 4.0.0's retired Codex `untrusted` approval value to
  `never` only inside usage refreshes, restoring rate-limit discovery on
  current Codex releases without changing normal Codex launches.
- Manage Claude Desktop alongside Codex Desktop in the `Super+I` assistants
  workspace, reclaiming either application when it is outside the workspace
  and launching only the missing desktop app.

## 11.0.1 - 2026-08-23

- Enable Omarchy's built-in generic media widget in the managed bar so MPRIS
  players such as Spotify and Brave expose now-playing controls after setup.
- Install and enable the Galaxy Buds plugin, surface its Bluetooth-pairing
  requirement, and preserve its right-bar placement and label configuration.

## 11.0.0 - 2026-08-23

- Back up the live compact Claude and Codex personal policy as the portable
  baseline. Retire the remaining private-policy bootstrap, Agent OS,
  Superpowers installers, bundled HTML skill, and custom skill clone/merge
  layer so none can resurrect the previous orchestration stack.
- Delegate shared skill installation to the upstream Skills CLI with
  `mattpocock/skills` as Haoshoku's single declared source for Claude Code and
  Codex. Full Arch and Debian setup reconcile the same source.

## 10.0.1 - 2026-08-20

- Remove retired cross-engine orchestration identifiers and role labels from
  maintained source, examples, ignore rules, and the packaged HTML skill while
  preserving native Claude and Codex subagent support.

## 10.0.0 - 2026-08-20

- Breaking: retire Haoshoku's custom Claude agent/wrapper runtime and bundled
  standalone Claude skills. `--claude` and `--claude-backup` now manage only
  `CLAUDE.md`, `statusline-command.sh`, and `.gitignore`; only an explicit
  `--skills` or `--skills-update` invocation syncs external skills for Claude
  and Codex, and source `agents/` directories are ignored.
  Upgrades deliberately do not recursively prune co-owned live directories, so
  remove any previously deployed files through an explicit reviewed path list.
- Back up the current compact Claude preferences policy and stop allowing
  `agents/` in the deny-first private-policy ignore template. Native Claude and
  Codex subagents remain available through their engines; retired cross-engine
  plugin workflows stay outside the package. Remove the retired `codex-rescue`
  display special case from the retained statusline.

## 9.3.0 - 2026-08-18

- Resync the bundled Claude runtime: the implement-work skill now runs a final
  cold Opus review over the full branch diff, re-run after any fix loop that
  changes it, with
  intermediate dispatch checks delegated to `sol-medium-wrapper`;
  `sol-medium-wrapper` now dispatches on the priority (fast) service tier,
  with the tier enforced in its receipt check; and `opus-reviewer` now
  explicitly pins `effort: high`, while the review-pr panel's Opus lens now
  documents `effort high` to match the pinned agent definition.
- Retire the `anveshaka` and `madhyastha` agents, removing them from the
  bundle, the deployment manifest, and the test pins. Upgrades leave the old
  agent definitions in `~/.claude/agents/`, where they remain visible in the
  agent picker; delete those files manually.
- Add a deployed Claude scratch-directory policy requiring scratch work under
  `~/agent-temp-dir-work`, explaining the `/tmp` quota rationale, and exempting
  launcher-owned `/tmp` paths. Because `--claude` deploys `CLAUDE.md` over the
  live copy, this is a user-visible policy change.

## 9.2.0 - 2026-08-17

- Resync the bundled Claude runtime from live: rename `sol-wrapper` to
  `sol-high-wrapper` and `luna-wrapper` to `luna-max-wrapper`, and add
  `sol-medium-wrapper`. Upgrades leave the old agent definitions in
  `~/.claude/agents/`, where the validator and launcher hard-refuse them but
  they remain visible in the agent picker; delete those files manually.

## 9.1.0 - 2026-08-16

- Install the KDE Connect backend for the default omaconnect plugin and start
  its daemon explicitly in Omarchy 4, where Hyprland does not process the XDG
  autostart entry, so phone sync is reliably available from login.
- Remove the retired Caelestia subsystem while retaining device-type routing as
  shared configuration for Omarchy and audio setup.

## 9.0.0 - 2026-08-16

- Breaking: Omarchy 4 or newer required; Omarchy 3 no longer supported.
  Migration, workspaces, hyprmoncfg, and plugin helpers gate on the installed
  Omarchy major version.
- The Hyprland overlay moved from `.conf` to Lua. Omarchy 4 loads user
  config via `require()` and no longer sources `.conf` files. Haoshoku
  deploys `~/.config/hypr/haoshoku/{bindings,workspaces}.lua` and appends
  exactly two `require` lines to `hyprland.lua`. Removes
  `configs/omarchy/{bindings,workspaces-pc,workspaces-laptop,monitors-pc,monitors-laptop}.conf`.
- Monitor configuration is now owned by the hyprmoncfg plugin. Haoshoku
  authors `~/.config/hyprmoncfg/profiles/*.json` instead of writing
  `monitors.conf`, and never writes `monitors.lua`. Removes
  `src/helpers/configure_omarchy_monitors.js`; `--monitors` now deploys
  hyprmoncfg profiles.
- Monitor-bound workspace rules moved into the hyprmoncfg PC profile,
  matched by hardware identity instead of connector name so they survive
  DP connector swaps. Laptop workspace rules are monitor-independent and
  remain in the Lua overlay.
- The PC Lua overlay no longer sets `GDK_SCALE`; display scaling belongs to
  the monitor profile, fixing Steam and Spotify rendering at 2x on scale-1 monitors.
- New `--3-4-migrate`: re-runnable, idempotent migration from an Omarchy 3
  layout. Strips dead `source =` lines, removes orphaned overlay `.conf`
  files, repoints theme paths, backs up and clears Omarchy's stock
  unmarked `monitors.lua` so hyprmoncfg can take ownership, deploys the
  Lua overlay and profiles, installs plugins, and validates. If Omarchy's
  legacy config shim is still present it reports validation deferred and
  asks for a reboot and re-run rather than claiming success.
- New `--omarchy-plugins`: installs and enables the plugins listed in
  `common/omarchy-plugins.json`,
  idempotent on both plugin id and enabled state, per-plugin failure
  non-fatal. Included in the default run. Entries may declare
  `disableOnInstall` to switch off a stock widget they replace, applied only
  when Haoshoku first creates the plugin and never re-applied. Bar placement,
  settings arrangement, and rollback removal are no longer managed.
- New `--omarchy-bar` deploys the owned `bar` key in Omarchy's `shell.json`,
  while `--omarchy-bar-backup` captures it back into the repo. Haoshoku claims
  `bar` wholesale, including bar-widget enablement, so Omarchy UI changes to
  bar-widget enablement are reverted on the next deploy. Every other top-level
  key — `idle`, `plugins`, `disabledPlugins`, `version`, and unknown keys — is
  preserved.
- New `--hyprmoncfg-backup`: pulls saved hyprmoncfg profiles back into the
  repo.
- Theme state paths follow Omarchy 4's move from
  `~/.config/omarchy/current` to `~/.local/state/omarchy/current` across
  the Kitty config, Kitty session files, and the Fish config.
- Hyprland config validation now parses `hyprctl configerrors` output; its
  exit status is always 0, so the exit code alone could never detect a
  broken config.
- On Omarchy 4, `hyprctl dispatch` evaluates its argument as Lua, so
  `haoshoku-special-workspace` now emits `hl.dsp.*` Lua expressions instead of
  the legacy `dispatch <name> <args>` form, which is a parse error on v4;
  dispatch failures now propagate as script failures rather than being masked.
- T3 Code moved from `special:t3code` to workspace 1. `SUPER+T` now focuses
  workspace 1 and launches T3 Code if missing via the `numbered` recipe; the
  bare `t3code` recipe is retired.
- The gaming-workspace toggle now emits v4 Lua dispatch expressions. On
  Omarchy 4, the legacy positional form is a parse error, which made
  `SUPER + SHIFT + G` a silent no-op.
- The gaming workspace moved from workspace 11 to workspace 2, so stock
  `SUPER+2` reaches it. `SUPER+SHIFT+G` still toggles it and now ensures Steam
  on both branches. Workspace 2 is a normal persistent workspace, so the old
  disappear-when-empty behavior is gone, and the hyprmoncfg PC profile now
  defines workspaces 1-10.
- The default Omarchy plugin set is now eight plugins: `tmn73.calendar`,
  `crmne.mpris`, `dorneles.lock-keys`, and `hass` were dropped, while
  `io.github.thetrueferret.decent-workspaces`, `dizziee.system-stats`, and
  `robzolkos.agent-usage` were added, the first and last displacing the stock
  `omarchy.workspaces` and `omarchy.agents` widgets.

## 8.6.1 - 2026-08-15

- Make the OpenCode seat, run-codex-task lifecycle, and Kitty theme tests
  hermetic so they provision their own state instead of depending on the
  developer machine, unblocking the npm publish workflow on a clean runner.

## 8.6.0 - 2026-08-15

- Add the fixed, bubblewrap-confined OpenCode GLM seat with receipt and
  workspace-attribution enforcement for wrapper-dispatched work.
- Add the Sonnet-supervised `opencode-wrapper` agent and package its fixed
  launcher as part of the public Claude runtime.
- Parse OpenCode export receipts from raw JSON stdout with a one-retry
  leading-preamble fallback, and let operators bypass network-resolving PATH
  shims with a validated `OPENCODE_SEAT_BIN` real-binary override.

## 8.5.4 - 2026-08-14

- Replace Debian T3 Code's mandatory Tailscale installation, authentication,
  pairing, and Serve flow with headless T3 Connect authorization and its
  upstream-managed relay client.
- Preserve ready or pending T3 Connect credentials across reruns, restart the
  current user's T3 service only when provisioning is needed, and verify the
  environment link without opening ports or changing Nginx, DNS, or firewall
  policy.

## 8.5.3 - 2026-08-14

- Make Debian T3 Code server setup install, enable, and verify Tailscale's
  persistent vendor service, authenticate disconnected nodes, create the
  private Tailscale Serve pairing endpoint, and verify it without exposing
  T3's loopback port or changing firewall policy.
- Support both root VPS installs and ordinary sudo-capable users, including
  validated Tailscale operator access for the user that owns the T3 service.

## 8.5.2 - 2026-08-14


## 8.5.1 - 2026-08-13

- Keep only ChatGPT on the monitor-following `special:assistants` workspace
  and its `Super+I` login/toggle path, leaving Claude Desktop unmanaged.

## 8.5.0 - 2026-08-13

- Move Claude Desktop and Codex Desktop into one monitor-following
  `special:assistants` workspace on `Super+I`, reclaim existing windows there,
  and launch the assistants automatically at login.
- Give T3 Code its own monitor-following `special:t3code` workspace on
  `Super+T`, replacing the former Tmux shortcut.
- Add a Twitch Brave Origin app and monitor-following `special:twitch`
  workspace on `Super+Shift+T`.

## 8.4.1 - 2026-08-12

- Make Meta+I switch to workspace 1, reclaim existing Claude and Codex windows there, and keep them tiled and unpinned.

## 8.4.0 - 2026-08-12

- Replace tiered Claude task routing with one capability-based path: Opus
  orchestrates, Sol handles reasoning/code/research, Luna runs at fixed maximum
  reasoning for PR reviews and human-facing HTML/docs, and Grok pairs on
  external research only when discovery identifies a load-bearing unknown.
- Bundle the complete portable Claude fallback runtime, including the named
  wrappers, review workflows, guarded Codex launcher, isolated Luna render
  workspace, discovering-work skill, and Samvada HTML deliverable skill.
  Fresh installs and backups now round-trip all managed runtime files without
  embedding a user-specific home path.

## 8.3.3 - 2026-08-12

- Replace the `Super+I` assistants workspace's ChatGPT Brave web app with
  Codex Desktop. Claude Desktop remains alongside it, and both desktop windows
  route to `special:assistants`, which follows the focused monitor. Arch setup
  provisions the Codex Desktop package alongside Claude Desktop.

## 8.3.2 - 2026-08-12

- Split the `Super+A` Haki Warp tab vertically with the configured `io-haki`
  Claude session above a fresh Codex session. Both panes start at `$HOME`,
  Claude receives initial focus, and the existing exact-window workspace
  ownership remains unchanged.

## 8.3.1 - 2026-08-12

- Fix `Super+A` after Warp session restoration by creating and focusing a
  dedicated Warp window before loading the Haki tab config. Reject unsupported
  tab colors at test time and use Warp's valid `magenta` color instead of
  `purple`.

## 8.3.0 - 2026-08-11

- Migrate every active Omarchy, Caelestia, and KDE terminal caller to Warp.
  `xdg-terminal-exec` now selects Warp, workspace 7 and the Haki/agents tabs
  use exact-address tags, and Kitty remains installed as an inactive fallback.
- Add JioHotstar as a `Super+J` special workspace and relocate Omarchy's
  toggle-split action to `Super+Ctrl+Shift+J`.

## 8.2.0 - 2026-08-10

- Move Close window from `Super+W` to `Super+Q` while intentionally leaving
  `Super+W` unbound, and remove the Obsidian shortcut; Obsidian remains
  launchable through Walker.

## 8.1.0 - 2026-08-08

- Provision GitHub's `gh-stack` extension without a prompt on both default
  setup paths. Detection now recognizes the real alias-first, tab-separated
  `gh extension list` output; existing installs remain silent, missing `gh`
  skips cleanly, and installation failures warn without aborting setup. The
  standalone `--gh-stack` mode now exits non-zero when provisioning fails.
- Ask for device type on every Arch-family full setup, including non-Omarchy
  systems, with a valid stored value preselected and PC—not Skip—preselected
  when stored config contains `null`. Keep the returned non-interactive value
  explicitly advisory: full-setup helpers route from persisted config instead.
  Offer every applicable portable developer component on both default OS paths,
  while keeping desktop-only audio, browser/MIME, scripts, Brave, Hyprland, and
  Omazed configuration off headless Debian servers. Preserve an accepted
  Superpowers registration across every later forced policy checkout by merging
  it back into the freshly checked-out settings. Preserve the
  previously unconditional Claude stay-awake and PR-watch behavior on Arch;
  non-interactive confirmations still decline genuine user decisions without
  hanging.

## 8.0.0 - 2026-08-08

- Make Omarchy's `deviceType` routing reachable: full setup now asks when no
  valid value is stored and persists an accepted `pc` or `laptop` selection in
  `~/.haoshoku.json` before audio, monitor, and workspace deployment. A laptop
  receives single-monitor workspace and monitor variants while keeping the PC
  workspace behavior otherwise identical; its monitor variant deliberately
  leaves GTK scaling to the panel. Choosing Skip, or using the PC fallback when
  the prompt cannot run, leaves device-specific audio unset, uses the PC
  fallback for Hyprland only for that run, and asks again next setup. Set or
  change the value with `haoshoku --device-type laptop` (or `pc`), and redeploy
  either half of the topology with `--workspaces` or `--monitors`.
- Pin workspace 8 to the primary monitor (DP-1) and workspace 9 to the
  rightmost monitor (HDMI-A-1) in the PC Omarchy workspace layout.
- Move `Super+B` (Flux), `Super+D` (DeFi), Notion, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, X,
  YouTube, Crunchyroll, Re:ANIME, Google Photos, Grok, and the default
  `http`/`https` desktop entry from Chromium to Brave Origin, and add
  `brave-origin-bin` to the Arch package set.
- Brave profiles start empty under `~/.config/brave-haoshoku/`: WhatsApp needs
  a fresh QR pairing from the phone, and every other migrated app needs a fresh
  login. Existing Chromium profiles remain untouched at
  `~/.config/chromium-haoshoku/`; nothing is deleted.
- During Omarchy setup, automatically keep Brave's managed-policy parents
  root-owned but deliberately user-own the leaf directory and both policy files
  so Omarchy can update `color.json` on every theme switch. Repair unsafe
  Brave/Chromium directory modes, write only incorrect policy files without
  sudo, and keep the anti-hijack policy in its own file so Omarchy never
  overwrites it.
- Give the DeFi browser profile a distinct violet window border (`#9762e2`) so
  its windows are identifiable at a glance against the Flux profile, which
  keeps the theme default. Implement this with a `border_color` window rule in
  `configs/omarchy/workspaces-pc.conf` and its laptop counterpart, matching the
  `chromium-defi` window class.
  Because Hyprland applies window rules when a window is created, an already-
  open browser keeps its old border until it is reopened.

## 7.9.0 - 2026-08-08

- Keep one dedicated home-rooted kitty terminal on workspace 7, starting it at
  login and reclaiming it if it moves without launching duplicates.
- Run fastfetch when an interactive terminal launches, while keeping
  non-interactive and non-TTY shells quiet.

## 7.8.0 - 2026-08-07

- Keep browser upload and download pickers visible while special workspaces
  are open by applying `float on`, `pin on`, and `center on` to the
  `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` dialog class. Scope the rules to the portal class so
  Nautilus remains unaffected.
- Recalibrate Zed's generated glass theme from two alpha tiers (`E6`/`D9`) to
  six calibrated tiers, accounting for stacked surfaces so the docked panes
  and agent panel remain visibly translucent instead of effectively opaque.
  Keep `elevated_surface.background` densest at `CC` so translucent context
  menus remain readable.

## 7.7.0 - 2026-08-07

- Make `Super+A` open a local kitty terminal rooted at home instead of attaching
  to a managed Remote Control session. A configured, syntactically valid Claude
  session name is passed literally to `claude -r`; direct resume still requires
  that name to resolve uniquely. Missing or null values start plain Claude, while
  rejected values are preserved and reported instead of being silently nulled.
- Disclose before Remote Control installation that accepting bypass permissions
  permanently changes Claude Code's machine-wide safety acceptance for every
  session, and explain how to reverse it manually.
- Quote every argument the special-workspace launcher hands to Hyprland, so app
  and browser shortcuts keep their arguments intact instead of letting the shell
  re-split anything containing spaces or punctuation.

## 7.6.0 - 2026-08-07

- Run the managed Claude Remote Control instances (`haki`, `dev`, `work`) in
  server mode (`claude remote-control --spawn same-dir --capacity 5
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions`) instead of a single fixed
  `--remote-control` session. Each instance is now a persistent host that spawns
  up to five on-demand sessions in its own directory — the phone can start new
  sessions on it — rather than one fixed session. A fresh account shows a
  one-time `Enable Remote Control? (y/n)` prompt on an instance's first start;
  attach once and press `y` (acceptance persists per account).

- Rename the home-root Claude Remote Control instance from `io` to `haki` and
  retire instances removed from the managed map by stopping and disabling their
  services before deleting their environment files. Retirement is derived from
  Haoshoku's installed state, refuses to kill the tmux session running the
  installer, and leaves unrelated template units untouched; the launcher now
  reports an uninstalled Haki instance accurately while the unit tolerates its
  environment file being absent during migration.

## 7.5.0 - 2026-08-06

- Make `Super+B` toggle the existing Flux Chromium window instead of opening a new
  window on every press: the normal Flux-owner launch routes started it without an
  explicit window class, so plain windows were born as `chromium` while the
  workspace probe matched `chromium-flux` exactly.
- Remove the Hey Email and Calendar shortcuts at the user's request, leaving both
  stock keys unbound and removing the service from active configuration.
- Move the file manager shortcut from `Super+F` to `Super+E`.
- Add a Re:ANIME special workspace on `Super+F` with the same focused-monitor
  show, focus, and hide behavior as YouTube and Crunchyroll.

## 7.4.0 - 2026-08-06

- Make Email, Calendar, and Grok shortcuts focus-aware with exact web-app
  classes, so they stop opening a duplicate window on every press.
- Keep special-workspace browser URL requests visible and let recipes continue
  when Hyprland dispatch IPC is unavailable.

## 7.3.0 - 2026-08-06

- Make special-workspace toggles monitor-aware without hiding or migrating
  panels: browser recipes open on the focused monitor, while pinned panels stay
  on their assigned monitor and focus an already-visible panel instead of
  toggling it away. Add distinct-monitor and per-recipe coverage so placement
  and follow-focus behavior cannot drift unnoticed.
- Add standalone `--scripts` and `--workspaces` deployment paths, preventing the
  tracked user scripts and Hyprland workspace overlay from drifting behind their
  live copies. The scripts path also prunes retired entries; the workspace path
  installs its helper and ensures Hyprland sources the overlay.
- Fix Chromium `--app` routing for WhatsApp, Notion, X, YouTube, and Crunchyroll.
  Chromium ignores `--class` under `--app` and derives the window class from the
  URL instead, so each app now uses its escaped derived class rather than an
  ineffective requested class. Shared web apps run through a Flux-profile
  wrapper so their sessions stay together; the wrapper is necessary because the
  launcher keeps only the first field of a desktop file's `Exec`. X is pinned to
  the portrait workspace, while YouTube and Crunchyroll get focus-following
  workspaces, with table-driven coverage guarding every recipe's monitor
  behavior.
- Restore durable Zed translucency and visible borders in the Omazed-generated
  theme. Zed requires the dotted `background.appearance` setting inside the
  theme style plus alpha-channel background colours; its own blur protocol is
  KDE-only, so the transparent surfaces rely on Hyprland to supply the blur.
- Move application keybindings into a refresh-safe overlay because
  `~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf` is an Omarchy template that `omarchy refresh`
  restores and overwrites. Hyprland adds bindings instead of replacing them, so
  every override explicitly unbinds first, while `keybinding-swaps.json` records
  each displaced default. The overlay also moves workspace toggles to shorter
  two-key shortcuts, and `Super+Z` now always opens a new Zed window with
  `zeditor --new` instead of focusing an existing one.
- Rename the `Super+I` panel from Claude to assistants and tile ChatGPT beside
  Claude. Deployment migrates a window stranded on the old special workspace,
  while the former direct ChatGPT shortcut is removed so repeated presses do not
  open duplicate windows.

## 7.2.2 - 2026-08-05

- Launch the agents special workspace in kitty instead of Alacritty, matching the
  kitty-first terminal setup. `--class haoshoku-agents` still sets the Wayland
  app_id, so the existing `match:class ^haoshoku-agents$` workspace rule continues
  to match.

## 7.2.1 - 2026-08-05

- During full setup, prompt (default Yes) to bootstrap the configured private
  Claude policy repository after the public baseline. An unreachable or
  authentication-failed repository now warns and lets setup continue; retry with
  `haoshoku --claude-bootstrap`. The checkout never runs `git clean`, preserving
  Omarchy's `~/.claude/skills/omarchy` symlink.

## 7.2.0 - 2026-08-05

## 7.1.0 - 2026-08-04

- Complete the Chromium-only migration found during live E2E validation:
  remove Brave, Floorp, Google Chrome, and Thorium from the package set; make
  Chromium the default web handler; and replace the remaining Brave WhatsApp
  and Notion desktop entries with isolated Chromium profiles.
- Install Omazed from Omarchy's package repository and hand Zed theme ownership
  to its generated palette. The setup path transactionally replaces the unsafe
  object-form theme selector before first launch, preserves all other Zed
  settings, restores the original on failure, and removes the retired
  Caelestia theme only after successful setup.
- Keep `bun-bin` in the Arch package set and add `~/.bun/bin` explicitly to the
  managed Bash environment, fixing Bun lookup in clean Omarchy Bash sessions.
- Restore the former Caelestia workspace workflow as an additive Omarchy user
  overlay. It preserves Omarchy visuals and stock shortcuts, restores the
  three-monitor map, uses a conflict-free special-workspace namespace, and
  replaces Brave profiles and PWAs with isolated Chromium data directories.
- Make the Arch desktop path Omarchy-native without restructuring the installer:
  prefer `yay` with `paru` fallback, route repository packages through `pacman`,
  install a single conflict-free Nerd Font, port the user's shell additions to a
  managed Bash fragment, and restore only Omarchy's user-owned `monitors.conf`.
- Replace CachyOS gaming meta-packages with Steam, GameMode, Gamescope, MangoHud,
  ProtonUp-RS, and Omarchy's GPU-aware 32-bit driver helper.
- Retire the KDE, Caelestia, SDDM, Fish, terminal-theme, Zed-theme, and wallpaper
  setup paths. Omarchy is now the sole owner of desktop appearance.

## 7.0.0 - 2026-08-04

## 6.2.0 - 2026-08-04

- Add the opt-in `--claude-bootstrap` mode for checking out the configured private
  Claude policy repository, including pre-mutation authentication checks and
  idempotent `origin` URL updates when `claudeBootstrapUrl` changes.

## 6.1.0 - 2026-08-01

- Preserve locally authored skills and cache branches during skill updates. `mergeSkills()`
  now reports same-named real local entries as local-wins shadows, separately from
  in-place and failed symlinks, while continuing to replace stale or foreign links.
  Cached repositories now check out their resolved default branch before fetching and
  hard-resetting; if checkout fails, the updater warns and keeps the stale cache rather
  than resetting the current branch and risking its commits.
- Harden every `safeCopyFile` backup slot by atomically claiming the write-once
  `.bak`, `.haoshoku-first-capture`, and versioned paths, and by stripping
  executable bits from every backup while preserving other permissions (so
  `0600` stays `0600` and `0755` becomes `0644`). Backups remain intentionally unpruned:
  automatic retention could discard the only copy of a later user edit, so
  cleanup stays an explicit user decision. Add behavioral coverage for the
  Claude first-capture gitignore allowlist, concurrent same-timestamp backups,
  and double-digit collision ordering.

## 6.0.1 - 2026-08-01

- Fix the npm publish gate's packaging guard timeout. Version 6.0.0 was tagged and released on GitHub but was never published to npm: `tests/claude_packaging.test.js` exceeded Bun's default 5000ms timeout on the CI runner while its cold-cache `npm pack --dry-run --json` operation took about 4 seconds, so the publish workflow stopped before `npm publish` ran. Version 6.0.1 is the first 6.x version actually published to npm.

## 6.0.0 - 2026-08-01

**Breaking change.** The public bundle no longer ships the executable Claude policy surface. `--claude` and `--claude-backup` now manage exactly three files — `CLAUDE.md`, `statusline-command.sh`, and `gitignore.template` (deployed as `~/.claude/.gitignore`). `settings.json` is no longer a `PERSONAL_FILES` entry, so neither command writes or overwrites it; the bundled `settings.json`, `conventions/`, `output-styles/`, `agents/`, and `workflows/` are deleted. Executable policy now comes from a private policy repository you bootstrap in place at `~/.claude/`; see `configs/claude/README.md` for the procedure. This public installer deliberately cannot fetch that repository. The independent `--skills` path is unchanged: it still creates `~/.claude/agents/` and symlinks agents into it.

- Report a bundled agent shadowed by a same-named real local file as an informational skip rather than a warning or symlink failure, while keeping the local file authoritative. `mergeAgents()` now summarizes agents correctly linked after the run, local shadows, and genuine failures separately on one grammatical line, so an already-correct steady-state run still reports its installed agents; `mergeSkills()` uses the same in-place quantity and wording. Stale or foreign destination symlinks are still replaced, actual filesystem errors remain failures, and `mergeAgents()` still returns every seen agent name, including local shadows. Also scrub Git's four pathspec-mode environment variables (`GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS`, `GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS`, `GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS`, and `GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS`) from Claude-home trackedness queries so inherited matching modes cannot suppress a deploy.
- Harden the Claude-home index guard against inherited Git repository overrides: each query now derives an environment from the current `process.env` and removes Git's repository-local and discovery variables before spawning, preventing exported `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` values from substituting a foreign index while preserving runtime `PATH` changes and fail-open behavior when Git is absent. Add regression coverage for foreign-index injection and a parent dotfiles repository containing `.claude/`; make the broken-gitdir fixture per-test and include a concrete `git restore` recovery command in tracked-file skip logs.
- Protect private Claude policy checkouts during `--claude`: before deploying each `PERSONAL_FILES` entry, query the index of a git repository rooted exactly at the injected Claude home and skip a tracked destination (including the mapped `.gitignore` and files with uncommitted modifications) with an explanatory log. The query fails open when git or repository metadata is unavailable or errors, so fresh-machine bootstrap still deploys all three files; `--claude-backup` remains unchanged. Add real-git regressions for tracked and untracked indexes, destination mapping, dirty tracked files, query failure, skip logging, and the first-capture allowlist behavior. The private-policy bootstrap now validates remote reachability before `git init`, and its backup warning makes clear that a visible untracked first capture needs committing or moving aside to survive `git clean -fd`.
- Make every `safeCopyFile` replacement recoverable: a write-once `.haoshoku-first-capture` slot preserves the earliest known live content (migrating a legacy `.orig` when present), the historical fixed `.bak` path remains as a write-once compatibility capture, and unpruned `.bak.<timestamp>` files preserve every differing live version with numeric suffixes on same-millisecond collisions. The Claude deny-first ignore template explicitly allows the first-capture suffix so it is visible to git; root `.bak` files remain ignored cleanup candidates, which the Claude bundle documentation now warns about.
- Remove `configs/claude/agents/` and `configs/claude/workflows/` from the public npm bundle and delete their merge-deploy and recursive-backup machinery. `--claude` and `--claude-backup` now manage exactly `CLAUDE.md`, `statusline-command.sh`, and `gitignore.template` (mapped to live `.gitignore`); executable policy comes from a private policy repository the user bootstraps in place at `~/.claude/`, which this public installer deliberately cannot fetch. The independent `--skills` path and its `mergeAgents()` ownership remain unchanged.
- Refuse Claude backup inputs containing literal absolute home-path leaks, including the destination-mapped live `.gitignore`; preserve clean sibling backups, report the offending source, and return backed-up/refused summary counts. Align documentation and CLI help with the three-file surface plus the separate private-policy and `--skills` paths, and require `bun test` to pass before the npm publish step can run.
- Remove `settings.json` from `PERSONAL_FILES` and remove `WIPE_DIRS` entirely; delete the bundled `settings.json`, `conventions/`, `output-styles/`, and stale `configs/codex-launcher/` duplicate; add an npm-pack-derived guard that rejects literal `/home/` or `/Users/` paths in packed `configs/claude/` files.
- Carry the deny-first `~/.claude/.gitignore` in the bundle as `configs/claude/gitignore.template`, deployed and backed up through a new optional `dest` field on `PERSONAL_FILES` entries. That ignore file is what makes a tracked `~/.claude` safe, and it was the one thing the separate private policy repository held that this bundle did not. It is stored under a `.template` name deliberately: a real `.gitignore` at that path is honoured by both git and npm-packlist inside this repository, and its `/*` deny-first rule would silently drop `statusline-command.sh` and `README.md` from the published tarball — the exact failure the existing statusline regression test exists to prevent. A new test asserts no `.gitignore` is ever added there.

## 5.15.1 - 2026-07-29

- Lower the bundled Claude session reasoning effort from `xhigh` to `high` in `configs/claude/settings.json`, mirroring the live `~/.claude/settings.json`. Because `settings.json` is a `PERSONAL_FILES` entry and `safeCopyFile` lets the bundle win whenever the two files differ, leaving the bundle at `xhigh` would have made the next `haoshoku --claude` apply overwrite the live setting back — visible only as a generic backup line that names no value. The rationale for the value itself is in the commit message. The Codex lane is unaffected: `run-codex-task.sh` derives effort from `--mode` independently of this key.
- Correct the changelog heading for the batch that shipped in 5.15.0. Its six entries were left under `## Unreleased - 2026-07-27` when `v5.15.0` was tagged, because `scripts/release.js` bumps `package.json` and `haoshoku.js` but never touches `CHANGELOG.md`. The heading is now `## 5.15.0 - 2026-07-28`, matching the tag date and the convention followed by earlier releases.

## 5.15.0 - 2026-07-28

- Make `~/.claude/agents/` and `~/.claude/workflows/` backup-only. `haoshoku --claude-backup` still copies their non-symlink contents into `configs/claude/`, but the Claude config deploy no longer reads them at all: `MERGE_DIRS` and its deploy loop are gone, `WIPE_DIRS` is restored to its earlier membership of `conventions`, `output-styles` and `hooks`, and a new `BACKUP_ONLY_DIRS` is read solely by `backupClaudeConfig()`. Four attempts to deploy safely into `~/.claude/agents/` each left a data-loss path — a wipe that deleted foreign symlinks, a backup change that made that deletion unrecoverable, a merge that wrote *through* symlinks and overwrote files outside the tree, and an `lstat`-gated walker that still mishandled the `.bak` write — so deploying into a directory this tool co-owns was abandoned rather than patched again. Note the narrower guarantee: it is the config deploy that never touches those directories. `~/.claude/agents/` remains owned by the skill manager, which still creates it and symlinks agents into it during `--skills`.
- Move the primary terminal from Ghostty back to kitty. Ghostty produced rendering artifacts with the NVIDIA 610 driver, while kitty was verified clean on the same machine and driver with more compositing enabled; Ghostty exposes no Linux renderer or vsync knob to tune (`window-vsync` is macOS-only). `Super+T`, `Super+A`, workspace 7, KDE's terminal shortcut, and `configureTerminals()` now target kitty. The terminal-agnostic `gen-sequences.py` maintenance tool and its OSC-palette documentation move beside the colour-free kitty config; the legacy `configs/ghostty/` directory and package remain retained but inactive.
- Synchronize `configs/claude/CLAUDE.md` and `configs/claude/settings.json` from the live `~/.claude/` copies through `--claude-backup`. The bundled policy file had drifted to an older roughly 5,386-word version while the live file had been substantially rewritten to roughly 2,495 words around tiers, the lane rule, review-as-a-station, and gateway policy. Because `CLAUDE.md` is a `PERSONAL_FILES` entry, the stale bundle was not passive archival debt: the next `haoshoku --claude` apply would have overwritten the current live policy and reverted those changes. The settings snapshot also picks up removal of the already-retired routing-gate Stop hook. Both files were secret-scanned before landing because this repository is public.
- Remove the retired routing-gate Stop hook from `configs/claude/hooks/`, including its script and 20-file, roughly 4,593-line test surface. The hook had already been deregistered from `settings.json` and moved under `~/.claude/.retired-20260726T181928Z/` on the live machine, but its old files remained in the tracked bundle. That mismatch was a resurrection path: `configure_claude.js` treats every `WIPE_DIRS` entry as wipe-and-replace during `syncClaudeConfig()`, so applying the bundle would have deleted the already-clean live `hooks/` directory and copied the retired hook back into service. `WIPE_DIRS` still contains `"hooks"`—the regression assertion in `tests/configure_claude.test.js` continues to guard the directory itself—while only the stale retired-hook contents were removed.
- Bundle the Claude policy surface — the Codex launcher, the wrapper definition, its validator hook, the seat definitions, the review station and the PR-review workflow — into `configs/claude/agents/` and `configs/claude/workflows/` as backup-only artifacts, retiring the separate private policy repository. These are captured by `--claude-backup` and are never deployed by `--claude`; see the backup-only entry above. `pr-review.js` also stopped hardcoding one organisation's repository and paths as defaults — `repo`, `dir` and `reviewFile` are now required arguments that throw when absent. Symlinked entries are excluded, because git stores a link's target rather than its content and such a backup would hold zero bytes.
- Prevent `backupClaudeConfig()` from capturing symlinked entries from any depth of a managed-directory tree. `copyDirRecursive()` now accepts an opt-in `skipSymlinks` mode plus an `onSkipSymlink` callback, and only the `--claude-backup` call site enables it; skipped destinations are removed and `log.warning` names each source path, while `syncClaudeConfig()` and every other caller keep the existing symlink-preserving default. This matters because Git stores a symlink as its target text rather than the pointed-to file's bytes: a link into another repository can therefore look like a tracked backup while containing no usable content and resolving to nothing on another checkout. `tests/configure_claude.test.js` exercises real top-level and nested files alongside links to an external scratch file, proving the real content is preserved, both links are absent from the bundle, and both skipped paths are reported.

## 5.14.0 - 2026-07-26

- Make Ghostty the primary terminal, retiring the Warp lane. `Super+T`, `Super+A` (agents) and `Super+7` now launch Ghostty in both `hypr-user` variants; Warp stays installed and keeps `configs/warp/`, but no keybind points at it. New `configs/ghostty/config.ghostty` deploys via `configureTerminals()` alongside Alacritty. Colours mirror the Zed Caelestia theme, which needed two files rather than one: `~/.config/fish/config.fish` cats `~/.local/state/caelestia/sequences.txt` at every shell start, and those OSC codes overwrite whatever palette a terminal loaded from its own config — so `sequences.txt` decides what an interactive shell looks like and the terminal config is only the pre-shell baseline. `configs/ghostty/gen-sequences.py` (a maintenance tool, not deployed) regenerates it from the Zed theme. The two palettes had diverged because Caelestia builds them from different colour sets — `term0`–`term15` for terminals via `gen_sequences()`, Catppuccin-named roles for Zed via its `zed.json` template — and all sixteen ANSI entries differ; background, foreground, cursor and selection already agreed. Resolved toward Zed except index 0: the Zed template maps `terminal.ansi.black` to `surface`, the window background, so `SGR 30` would be invisible, and index 0 keeps Caelestia's lifted `term0` (`#343434`). Both helper scripts collapse in the process — Ghostty opens its own window under its own PID and accepts `--class`, so Hyprland's execrule lands and a `windowrule` pins the agents window declaratively, where the Warp versions had to diff the client list against a pre-spawn snapshot because every Warp window shared one class and one warm PID. `warp-workspace-7` is replaced by `ghostty-workspace-7` and added to the retired-local-bin cleanup list. Caelestia's `general.apps.terminal` must be `["ghostty", "-e"]`, since Caelestia appends a command to that array. Live verified: the rendered palette pixel-matches the theme (uniform ~2–4/255 low, from Hyprland's global `opacity 0.95`, which applies to Zed identically), the agents `windowrule` places the window with no exec prefix, and `ghostty-workspace-7` spawns onto ws 7. Regression coverage in `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js` and `tests/install_user_scripts.test.js`.
- Delete the routing-gate's unresolvable-write counter. It reported 219, then 152, and never produced an actionable signal: it fired when a command's text mentioned a tracked root, but the user works *in* those roots, so nearly every command matched — including commands that write nothing, like `cd ~/personal/Haoshoku && git diff --stat`. The heuristic selected for "commands about your own code", which is all of them. The signal it was meant to carry is already carried by the standing caveat that heredocs and other shell writes are untracked. Removed: all counting, the `include_unresolvable` plumbing, its participation in the acknowledgement dedup key, the message line, and the tests that existed only to assert counting. `REDIRECTION_SCANNER_SHA256` was re-pinned deliberately and with explicit human authorization — the counter lived inside the pinned span — while `DISPATCH_FAILED_SHA256` is unchanged, confirming the edit stayed in its intended span.
- Scope routing-gate tracking to roots that can hold review debt. The gate classified write-shaped commands anywhere on the filesystem, which in one session produced 219 reports that were almost all `/tmp`, Codex run dirs, `/dev/null` and test scaffolding — honest but unactionable. Tracking is now limited to `~/personal`, `~/defi`, `~/.claude` and `~/.codex` via a `realpath` + separator-boundary comparison, so `personalX` cannot match `personal` and `..` cannot escape. This is a human-authorized scope *reduction*, not a tightening, and is recorded as such in the source.

## 5.13.2 - 2026-07-26

- Refresh the Zed Caelestia theme from the theme-editor export. `configs/zed/themes/caelestia.json` is replaced wholesale; the export is a superset of what shipped before, so nothing is dropped. `border` and `border.variant` move to opaque mint (`#98EDCEFF`) from the dark `#1E1E25` pair, and gutter line numbers, the active line number, the active wrap guide and indent guides become mint as well. Newly present: `editor.indent_guide_active`, `minimap.thumb.{background,hover_background,border}`, `panel.{indent_guide,indent_guide_hover,overlay_background,overlay_hover}` and the `version_control.*` family — keys the previous file predated. Only the theme JSON is adopted; its `extension.toml` is not, because `syncZedTheme()` serves the theme from `~/.config/zed/themes/` and installing it as a dev extension would put a second "Caelestia" entry in the theme picker.
- Stop the routing-gate inventing targets and losing real debt. Two defects, neither of which reduces what the gate blocks. First, worker dispatches discharged writes they never reviewed: `transcript_uncovered` dropped every write older than the last dispatch *before* receipt coverage was consulted, so an unrelated implementation dispatch silently cleared earlier unreviewed writes — two genuinely unreviewed chair-authored files vanished that way. The dispatch-based discharge is removed entirely; a write now stays uncovered until an actual `mode=review` receipt covers it by workspace containment and timestamp. The correct consequence is that the uncovered set grows across a long session until a covering review runs, and the acknowledgement dedup means the gate only speaks when that set changes. Second, the shell scanner named targets that do not exist, reading command text without checking the path was absolute and metacharacter-free.
- Version-control the Codex dispatch kit and back up the live Claude config, including the former orchestration DAG reframe, the blocked-sink rule, the OpenCode lane removal, and the switch to the Direct output style.
- Add `pr-watch`: a watch-only PR snapshot/diff/readiness core with a CLI and deploy helper, plus a `readiness_lost` event, a `gh` timeout, and a single-instance lock.
- Derive Codex reasoning effort from `--mode` rather than a global pin — `review` → `xhigh`, `implementation` → `high` — with upward-only escalation gated on a format-valid `--effort-justification` token. Basis: quality is not monotonic in effort (GPT-5.6 system card, 2026-06-25).
- Block once per distinct uncovered state in the routing gate, and never suppress a suspected-stale transcript.

## 5.13.1 - 2026-07-21

- Enforce the routing-gate test suite's pristine-oracle digest. Post-release review of v5.13.0 found that `pristine_hook_copy` documented the oracle's sha256 in a comment but checked only `is_file()`. A probe proved that empty and wrong-but-parseable files were both accepted silently, so every differential monotonicity test would compare against whatever the fixture happened to contain while still reporting green. The digest is now computed at copy time and raises `ValueError` on mismatch; verified by reproducing the reviewer's probe (valid accepted, empty rejected, wrong rejected). Also corrects a superseded deploy doc: `STATE.md` still carried the hand-copy command that created the nested `hooks/tests/routing-gate/` layout — the exact command behind the 9-of-78 under-collection bug fixed in 5.13.0.

## 5.13.0 - 2026-07-21

- Add the `claude-stay-awake` sleep inhibitor. `configs/claude-stay-awake/` ships the four-mode bash script and its systemd **user** unit, and `configs/claude/settings.json` gains the `SessionStart` hook that starts it, so the machine never suspends while a Claude session is running. `syncClaudeStayAwake` mirrors `configure_worktree_cleanup.js`: it deploys the script to `~/.local/bin/` (chmod 755) and the unit to `~/.config/systemd/user/`, then daemon-reloads and enables the service through an injectable, fail-open runner that never throws when `systemctl` is missing. `backupClaudeStayAwake` snapshots live → repo. Exposed as `--claude-stay-awake` / `--claude-stay-awake-backup` and wired into the CachyOS flow. 10 new tests cover both systemctl-missing paths, enable/skip, backup, and the alias.
- Land the routing-gate S3A tighten-only fix and its 78-test harness. All five characterization flips are `under_block → neutral`, with zero unpermitted flips — every change removes an under-blocking behaviour, so the gate only ever gets noisier or detects more. Included: torn-tail treated as staleness evidence rather than a whole-hook fail-open, a suspected-staleness detector with a bounded re-poll, writer-verb detection (`cp`/`mv`/`install`/`tee`/`dd`/`rm`/`sed -i`), a receipt future-skew bound, per-target receipt coverage (previously one receipt discharged everything), and an honest scope message that adds the missing `grok-wrapper`. Merged on explicit human instruction with review debt recorded: the S3A-R adversarial cross-review, live-fire, and cold-madhyastha acceptance did not run.
- Make the routing-gate suite portable. Relocating it into Haoshoku had broken it three ways — the nested `tests/routing-gate/` directory broke `tests.harness` imports so only 9 of 78 tests were collected, `parents[1]` no longer resolved to the hook, and the pristine oracle was read via `git show` against a scratch-repo commit. Flattened to `configs/claude/hooks/tests/` with the oracle vendored as a fixture, so the suite also runs once deployed to `~/.claude/hooks/`, which is not a repository.

## 5.12.2 - 2026-07-21

- Deploy `~/.claude/hooks/` via `WIPE_DIRS`. `configs/claude/hooks/` (the routing-gate Stop hook) now installs on sync and snapshots on backup, symmetric with `conventions/` and `output-styles/`; previously it was backup-only — committed to the repo but never installed on a fresh machine. The directory is Haoshoku-owned, so sync wipes and replaces it. Two regression guards were added after adversarial review pointed out the suite never exercised `"hooks"` by name: a manifest assertion that `WIPE_DIRS` includes it, and a replace test pinned to the literal `"hooks"` rather than an array index, proving a stale live hook the bundle no longer ships is removed while a bundled one is deployed. Both verified failing when `"hooks"` is dropped from the array.

## 5.12.1 - 2026-07-19

- Drop the ChatGPT PWA from the `Super+I` workspace. `configs/scripts/claude-desktop-toggle` now manages only the native `claude-desktop` app on `special:claude-desktop` — the Brave PWA is no longer launched, reclaimed, or routed there, and its windowrule is gone from `hypr-user-pc.conf`. Removing the second window removed the reason for the geometry code: the helper used to compute a floating top/bottom stack by hand, including reserved-strip offsets for Caelestia's side bar and a transform check because DP-2 is rotated. Hyprland tiles a single window into the work area and already accounts for both, so `place_stack` and its `movewindowpixel`/`resizewindowpixel` math are deleted (~50 lines); `settiled` remains to reclaim a window an older stacking version left floating at half height, and is a no-op on an already-tiled window. Live verified: the helper tiled the existing Claude window from 988x934 to 988x1878 and launched nothing. Regression coverage in `tests/install_user_scripts.test.js` and `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js`, both observed failing under mutation.

## 5.12.0 - 2026-07-18

- Add a managed Caelestia shell-restart shortcut. Both `hypr-user` variants add the additive, intentionally unlocked `Super+Shift+Delete` bind for `~/.local/bin/caelestia-restart`; the lock screen lives inside the restarted shell, so a `bindl` would unlock the machine. The new POSIX helper serializes restarts with a kernel-released `flock`, and closes that lock fd (`9>&-`) across every child — the started shell is a daemon that outlives the script, and an inherited fd would hold the lock for the whole session, leaving the shortcut working exactly once per login. It selects instances by `qs list --all` filtered to Caelestia's own `shell.qml` and validates PIDs as unsigned integers before any signal (a negative value is a process-group selector, so `kill -TERM -1` would end the session). Every call that talks to the shell socket is `timeout`-bounded, escalation runs cooperative kill → TERM → KILL, and success requires both a fresh IPC round-trip and that nothing targeted for the kill is still alive — a survivor answers IPC exactly as a new shell would. The IPC wait is a 45s wall-clock deadline, measured against a ~14s warm start. Failure feedback uses `hyprctl notify`, not the shell-owned notification daemon. Regression coverage asserts against comment-stripped source so ordering checks cannot be satisfied by documentation.
- Replace Vesktop with the official Discord client. `common/paru_applist.txt` installs `discord`, `configs/mimeapps/mimeapps.list` points `x-scheme-handler/discord` at `discord.desktop`, the redundant `vesktop` entry is dropped from `configs/caelestia/cli.json`, and both Caelestia variants pin the official client's lowercase `discord` class (matching `StartupWMClass` in `discord.desktop`) to workspace 4 — window rule and the `Super+4` launch bind. The ws 4 pin overrides Caelestia's stock `rules.conf:39`, which also matches `discord` and would otherwise route it to `special:communication`; that override is not new, since the stock rule matched `vesktop` the same way and the pin already took precedence. Regression coverage in `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js`. Note the repo had drifted from the machine: `vesktop` was no longer installed and Discord was already running on workspace 4.
- Make the `Super+A` agents tab Claude-only. `configs/warp/tab_configs/agents.toml` was a `claude | codex` vertical split; it now ships a single Claude pane, and Codex is started by hand when it is actually wanted. With one pane there is no root split pane to declare — verified against Warp by deploying a same-shaped throwaway tab config and confirming Warp parsed it and applied the declared title rather than falling back to a default shell. The regression test asserts against directive lines only, stripping comments, because the file documents the split it used to be.

## 5.9.1 - 2026-06-17

- Add a managed microphone mute shortcut. New `configs/scripts/mic-toggle` toggles the current default audio source through `wpctl` (with `pactl` fallback), sends a desktop notification for muted/unmuted state, and restores the input source volume to 100% whenever it unmutes so a stale zero-gain capture state does not silently break voice input again. Both Caelestia variants now override stock `Super+Shift+M` (speaker mute) and bind it to `~/.local/bin/mic-toggle`. Regression coverage in `tests/install_user_scripts.test.js` and `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js`; live verified against the FIFINE default source.

## 5.9.0 - 2026-06-17

- Make COSMIC Files the Haoshoku-managed default file manager. `cosmic-files` is now in `common/paru_applist.txt`, `configs/mimeapps/mimeapps.list` sets `inode/directory=com.system76.CosmicFiles.desktop`, and both Caelestia variants rebind `$kbFileExplorer` to `cosmic-files` because Caelestia's stock Super+E bind is expanded before `hypr-user.conf` is sourced. Regression coverage in `tests/cachyos.test.js`, `tests/configure_mimeapps.test.js`, and `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js`.
- Install Codex by default alongside the managed Codex config. `configureCodex()` now runs `bun install -g @openai/codex` when the `codex` command is missing, then syncs `configs/codex/AGENTS.md` into `~/.codex/`. This keeps fresh installs aligned with Claude Code instead of requiring a manual Codex install. Regression coverage in `tests/configure_codex.test.js`.
- Harden the Super+A agents workspace against duplicate launches. Both PC and laptop Caelestia variants now `unbind = Super, A` before adding Haoshoku's managed agents bind, and `configs/scripts/agents-toggle` serializes the whole toggle/launch path with an `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` lock so duplicate near-simultaneous invocations cannot spawn two Warp agents windows. The live Caelestia prefs and `~/.local/bin/agents-toggle` were redeployed and re-backed up into Haoshoku.

## 5.8.0 - 2026-06-16

- Track the `~/defi` git-worktree weekly-cleanup system. New `configs/worktree-cleanup/` ships `cleanup-worktrees.sh` (removes only provably-safe worktrees — clean + every commit already on a remote + PR merged or branch merged — and reports the rest: dirty, detached, unpushed, open-PR, or holding gitignored `superpowers/` artifacts), its `test-cleanup.sh` unit tests, and the `defi-worktree-cleanup.service`/`.timer` systemd **user** units (`OnCalendar=Fri 18:00`, `Persistent=true`). `src/helpers/configure_worktree_cleanup.js` (`--worktree-cleanup` / `--worktree-cleanup-backup`) deploys the script to `~/defi/.worktree-cleanup/` (chmod 755) and the units to `~/.config/systemd/user/`, then — the first place Haoshoku drives `systemctl` rather than only copying files — runs a guarded `daemon-reload` + `enable --now` on the timer (skips with an actionable hint when `systemctl --user` is unavailable; the enable step is injectable so tests never touch the real service manager). Regression coverage in `tests/configure_worktree_cleanup.test.js`.
- Sync skills to Codex too. `syncSkills` now symlinks every skill into `~/.agents/skills/` (where Codex reads Agent Skills) in addition to `~/.claude/skills/`, by calling the existing `mergeSkills` a second time with that destination. New injectable `skillsDir`/`agentsSkillsDir` options (default to the real dirs) make the dual-target behavior unit-testable without touching the live config. Previously Codex skills had to be symlinked by hand (README Option 3) and drifted — only `teaching-deep-understanding` was linked, while `testing` and `defi-worktree-setup` were missing. Regression coverage in `tests/skill_manager.test.js`.

## 5.5.3 - 2026-05-31

- Pin the FIFINE USB mic as the default capture source. New `configs/audio/wireplumber/pc/52-fifine-default-source.conf` raises the FIFINE's `priority.session` to 3000 so it wins default-source selection deterministically. Without it the default input is fragile: by stock `priority.session` the Lenovo webcam mic (2109) outranks the FIFINE (2100), so a WirePlumber configured-default state reset, a fresh setup, or a newly-enumerated device would silently route the default mic to the webcam. The rule auto-deploys via the existing device-routed `wireplumber/pc/` path in `configure_audio.js` (no code change needed) and is documented in `configs/audio/CLAUDE.md`. Regression coverage in `tests/configure_audio.test.js` asserts the drop-in ships with the FIFINE `node.name` and `priority.session = 3000`. Live-verified: WirePlumber restarts cleanly with the drop-in, the default source is the FIFINE at priority 3000, and audio output is intact.

## 5.5.2 - 2026-05-31

- Add the agents split-workspace for `Super+A`. The `claude` cli.json toggle (a single-pane `kitty --class=kitty-claude` running `claude -r io`) is replaced by an `agents` toggle that launches `kitty --class=kitty-agents --session=~/.config/kitty/agents.session` — a horizontal split running `claude -r io` (left) alongside a `codex resume` of the shared "io" thread (right). The new `configs/kitty/agents.session` ships the kitty session recipe, and `configureTerminals()` in `cachyos.js` now deploys it to `~/.config/kitty/agents.session` (file-by-file, alongside `kitty.conf`) so the toggle's `--session=` path is never a dangling reference on a fresh install. On the PC variant `Super+A` runs `hyprctl dispatch focusmonitor DP-2` before toggling so the split always lands on the leftmost portrait monitor, and `Super+D` (communication) is rebound with a `focusmonitor HDMI-A-1` prefix so it always opens on the rightmost screen; the laptop variant keeps the bare `caelestia toggle agents` with no monitor forcing (single eDP-1 panel). Regression coverage in `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js` for the `agents` toggle shape, the session-file content, and the PC/laptop bind routing.
- Restore work that previously lived only in the live `~/.config/caelestia/` and was never committed, so the v5.5.1 config sync reverted `Super+A` to the old single-pane `claude` toggle. Landing it in the repo (cli.json + both hypr-user variants + the session file + deploy wiring) makes the agents split survive future `apply` runs.

## 5.5.1 - 2026-05-25

- Revert the Vivaldi browser trial introduced in PR #7. `Super+W` is rebound from `caelestia toggle vivaldi` back to `caelestia toggle brave-work` (matching Brave's `Profile 1` "Defi" titled window), and `Super+B` is restored for `caelestia toggle brave-personal` (Brave's `Default` "Flux" titled window). The `brave-personal` and `brave-work` cli.json toggle entries and the matching `special:brave-personal` / `special:brave-work` windowrules (with fullscreen-override opacity) are re-added. `vivaldi` is removed from `common/paru_applist.txt` and uninstalled from the machine. ZapZap (WhatsApp Flatpak in `special:communication`) and Cohesion (Notion app on workspace 10) — also from PR #7 — remain untouched; they're stable in daily use.

## 5.5.0 - 2026-05-23

- Back up the current Zed Caelestia theme transparency model. The vendored `configs/zed/themes/caelestia.json` now carries `background.appearance: "blurred"` plus alpha/transparent backgrounds for the editor, gutter, terminal, panel, toolbar, and tab surfaces. The older `experimental.theme_overrides` block is removed from `configs/zed/settings.json`, keeping the Zed settings file focused on selecting the Caelestia theme while the theme file owns its own visual styling.

## 5.4.0 - 2026-05-22

- Trial Vivaldi, ZapZap, and Cohesion as Brave-PWA replacements (PR #7). The Super+W browser toggle is rebound from `caelestia toggle brave-work` to `caelestia toggle vivaldi` (matching class `vivaldi-stable`), and the Super+B personal Brave toggle plus the Brave personal/work special workspaces are removed. WhatsApp Web (previously a Brave PWA at `brave-hnpfjngllnobngcgfapefoaidbinmjnm-Default`) is replaced by the ZapZap Flatpak in the Caelestia communication toggle and the hypr-user special-workspace rules. The Notion workspace (previously the Brave PWA `brave-adaalabfemebkikihnkbonlockjjpbml-Default` on named workspace `0`) is replaced by `cohesion-git`, routed by class `cohesion` on workspace 10 with Super+0 launch/switch behaviour. Brave stays installed as a fallback while the new stack is trialed. Regression coverage in `tests/cachyos.test.js` and `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js` for the new toggles, removed Brave routing, the ZapZap/Cohesion migrations, and the fullscreen opacity rule.

- Track the `caelestia-sddm` SDDM login theme + its auto-sync posthook inside Haoshoku's CachyOS setup. `installCaelestia()` now installs `caelestia-sddm-minimalistv2-git` via `paru` (outside the `skipHyprlandPackages` branch — the SDDM theme is not a Hyprland compositor package; non-fatal — a failed install warns and continues). `configs/caelestia/cli.json` ships `wallpaper.postHook` + `theme.postHook` entries so Caelestia re-runs the SDDM sync on every wallpaper/colour change. A new `configureSddm()` helper writes `/etc/sudoers.d/caelestia-sddm-sync` (scoped to exactly `sync.sh --posthook` — least privilege) so the posthook runs without a password. The sudoers write is a single validated root transaction (`visudo -c -f <tmpfile>` before `install`, same-shell `rm` on failure) so a syntax error can never lock the user out of sudo. All three pieces — package, postHooks, sudoers — are gated together by the Caelestia install decision; a CachyOS user who declines Hyprland gets none of them. New `--sddm-posthook` CLI flag re-writes just the sudoers rule.

## 5.3.1 - 2026-05-22

- Make the Zed editor background transparent and blurred. A new `experimental.theme_overrides` block in `configs/zed/settings.json` sets `background.appearance` to `"blurred"` and drops the editor/panel/tab/terminal backgrounds to 60%-opacity alpha, so the editor background is frosted-translucent (the compositor blurs through it) while text stays fully opaque. Done at the app layer rather than via a Hyprland window-opacity rule — that route dimmed the text itself and hurt readability.

## 5.3.0 - 2026-05-22

- Add audio config tracking. New `configs/audio/` holds the PipeWire/WirePlumber drop-ins for bit-perfect lossless playback; `src/helpers/configure_audio.js` provides `syncAudioConfig`/`backupAudioConfig`/`configureAudio`, exposed as `--audio` / `--audio-backup` and run as part of the CachyOS setup. The portable PipeWire drop-ins (`pipewire.conf.d/`, `pipewire-pulse.conf.d/`) deploy on any machine; the WirePlumber drop-in is device-routed under `wireplumber/<deviceType>/` because it hard-pins a specific output device. `readDeviceType` was extracted from `configure_caelestia_prefs.js` into `src/common/utils.js` so both helpers share it.
- Add `mimeapps` config tracking. New `configs/mimeapps/mimeapps.list` + `src/helpers/configure_mimeapps.js` (`syncMimeappsConfig`/`backupMimeappsConfig`) + `--mimeapps` / `--mimeapps-backup` version-control the XDG default-application associations (default image viewer, URI scheme handlers). Single portable file, no device routing.
- Add the Caelestia lock-screen portrait-fix kit. New `configs/caelestia-lockfix/` ships `apply.sh` plus two QML patches that fix the Caelestia lock screen on portrait monitors (a workaround for an upstream Caelestia bug). `src/helpers/configure_lockfix.js` (`--lockfix` / `--lockfix-backup`) deploys the kit to `~/.local/share/caelestia-lockfix/`, and `installCaelestia()` now runs `apply.sh` automatically after `caelestia-shell` is installed — non-fatally, so a patch failure never aborts setup.
- Add a sysmon (btop) toggle to the Caelestia config.
- Stop tracking `~/.claude.json`. `backupClaudeConfig` was copying it raw into this public repo, but `~/.claude.json` is Claude Code runtime state (caches, usage stats, per-project session metadata, `oauthAccount`) — not reproducible config. Removed `claude.json` from `PERSONAL_FILES` and deleted `configs/claude/claude.json`; the genuine Claude config (`settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `conventions/`, `output-styles/`) stays tracked.
- Loosen value-pinned config tests. The zed-theme and caelestia workspace-routing tests asserted exact personal-config values (theme hex, app classes/commands) and broke whenever a `--*-backup` captured legitimate config drift. They now assert structure — a valid hex color, and the launch-if-missing bind shape — so backups no longer fight the test suite.
- Refresh the tracked config snapshot from the current machine: `hypr-user-pc.conf` (workspace 0 migrated from the Cohesion Flatpak to the Notion Brave-PWA, plus a `Super+Print` per-monitor screenshot bind), Zed settings + theme, and Claude `settings.json`.

## 5.2.7 - 2026-05-21

- Fix `installCaelestia()` silently leaving stock CachyOS Hyprland configs in place, which orphans the deployed `~/.config/caelestia/hypr-user.conf`. CachyOS Hyprland edition ships `/etc/skel/.config/hypr/` containing a stock `hyprland.conf` (no `source = $cConf/hypr-user.conf` line). That stock dir lands in every fresh user's home before haoshoku ever runs. Caelestia's `install.fish` then refuses to clobber the existing `~/.config/hypr/` and skips its own symlink step entirely. Result: Hyprland reads CachyOS's `hyprland.conf` which never sources `hypr-user.conf`, so `haoshoku --caelestia-prefs` deploys monitor/keybind/exec-once overrides that no Hyprland session can see. New `moveStockHyprConfigAside()` helper detects this case (regular dir or symlink-to-elsewhere at `~/.config/hypr/`) and renames it to `~/.config/hypr.bak.<timestamp>` before invoking install.fish. Idempotent: an existing correct symlink (`~/.config/hypr` → `~/.local/share/caelestia/hypr`) is left alone. Existing installs can recover by running `mv ~/.config/hypr ~/.config/hypr.cachyos-default.bak; fish ~/.local/share/caelestia/install.fish; haoshoku --caelestia-prefs; hyprctl reload`.
- Add 3 tests in `tests/configure_hyprland.test.js`: stock dir gets moved aside with original content preserved in `.bak.<ts>`, correct Caelestia symlink is left untouched (no spurious backups), and a wrong-target symlink is moved aside as defense against leftover state.

## 5.2.6 - 2026-05-21

- Fix the default `bun haoshoku.js` Hyprland step to match what `haoshoku --hyprland` already does. The prompt copy ("Install Hyprland + Caelestia rice (parallel to KDE)?") was hardcoded around an assumption of a current KDE session, defaulted to NO regardless of detected DE, and never asked the user's device type or current DE. As a result: Hyprland-edition CachyOS installs got a misleading prompt + a redundant `pacman -S hyprland …` install, and laptop users got the PC `hypr-user.conf` (NVIDIA + multi-monitor pins) because `syncCaelestiaPrefs()` fell back to the PC variant without a `deviceType` in `~/.haoshoku.json`. Now `configureHyprland()` detects `$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, defaults the prompt to YES when Hyprland is already running, and on confirm calls `promptDesktopEnvironment()` + `promptDeviceType()` before bootstrapping Caelestia. The DE answer is forwarded as `skipHyprlandPackages: de === "hyprland"`; the device answer is persisted to `~/.haoshoku.json` so the PC vs laptop hypr-user variant deploys correctly on first install. The post-install SDDM hint now only mentions the Plasma fallback when the user actually came from KDE.
- Add `deployWallpapers()` to copy `deskback/*` into `~/Pictures/Wallpapers/` as part of the Hyprland setup. Idempotent — existing files in the destination are skipped so user-added wallpapers and re-runs both survive. Runs after `installUserScripts()` so the rest of the Hyprland install path is unchanged.
- Add `thunar` to `common/paru_applist.txt` for users who want a graphical file manager on the Hyprland session (Caelestia doesn't bundle one).
- Add 9 tests in `tests/cachyos.test.js`: no more "parallel to KDE" copy, `promptDesktopEnvironment` + `promptDeviceType` imported and called before `installCaelestia`, `skipHyprlandPackages` forwarded based on DE answer, `deployWallpapers` runs after `installCaelestia` and targets `~/Pictures/Wallpapers`, `deskback/` ships at least one file, and `thunar` is in the AUR list.

## 5.2.5 - 2026-05-21

- Skip the paru per-package install loop for packages already in pacman's local DB. `installPackagesFromFile()` now snapshots `pacman -Qq` once and filters `common/paru_applist.txt` down to the missing set before invoking paru. AUR packages installed via paru land in the same local DB as repo packages, so the snapshot covers both. On a fresh CachyOS install nothing changes — every package is missing, every package gets installed. On a re-run or partial install, the loop drops from ~75 paru invocations (each paying an AUR HTTP roundtrip for AUR packages) to only the truly missing ones. Failure of the snapshot itself (e.g. pacman lock contention) falls back to the prior "try to install everything" behavior so no regression. The pre-filter only fires when the installer command contains `paru` or `pacman` — flatpak invocations skip it.
- Add `--needed` to the paru install command. Catches the edge case where exact-name pre-filter misses a `provides` relationship: e.g. the list pins `bun-bin` but the user already has a different package providing `bun`. `--needed` lets paru resolve the provides graph and skip cleanly instead of installing a redundant `-bin` variant.

## 5.2.4 - 2026-05-21

- Fix CachyOS shells crashing after every command with `test: Missing argument at index 3` from `/usr/share/cachyos-fish-config/conf.d/done.fish` line 229. `configureFishShell()` was installing `franciscolourenco/done`, `meaningful-ooo/sponge`, `jorgebucaran/nvm.fish`, and `joseluisq/gitnow` via fisher — but `configs/fish/config.fish` line 1 already sources `/usr/share/cachyos-fish-config/cachyos-config.fish`, which CachyOS ships with the same four plugins pre-installed under `/usr/share/cachyos-fish-config/conf.d/`. Both copies loaded on every shell start, double-registered `__done_ended` for `fish_postexec`, and tripped over each other's state so `__done_min_cmd_duration` was empty by the time the handler fired. `configureFishShell()` now installs only `jorgebucaran/fisher` (the manager itself, so users can still add unrelated plugins later) and skips the four duplicates. Users with the old install can recover by running `fisher remove franciscolourenco/done meaningful-ooo/sponge jorgebucaran/nvm.fish joseluisq/gitnow` then `exec fish`.

## 5.2.3 - 2026-05-20

- Add Caelestia app-workspace launch behavior to the persisted `hypr-user` variants. App-routed normal workspaces now switch first, then launch any missing mapped app: `Super+0` opens Cohesion, `Super+2` opens Steam on the PC template, `Super+4` opens Vesktop, and `Super+5` opens both Teams and Telegram. The bindings are guarded with `hyprctl clients -j` checks so repeated workspace activations do not spawn duplicate windows.
- Make the special-workspace mapping explicit in both `hypr-user` variants and `cli.json`: Signal + WhatsApp Web live in `special:communication`, 1Password in `special:1password`, Spotify in `special:music` via `Super+M`, Brave personal in `special:brave-personal`, and Brave work in `special:brave-work`.
- Extend the PC Caelestia monitor policy so VRR is disabled on every output, not just the rotated NVIDIA portrait monitor. The existing PowerMizer pin remains the mechanism that keeps the multi-monitor setup stable.
- Add a deployed `game-performance` PATH-shadow wrapper for CachyOS game launches. The wrapper enables DP-1 VRR and Caelestia game mode for the lifetime of the game process, then reverts both on exit.
- Expand `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js` to lock the normal-workspace launch bindings and special-workspace toggle/routing model.

## 5.2.2 - 2026-05-20

- Apply the Brave personal/work profile directory swap to `configs/caelestia/cli.json` so fresh `haoshoku --hyprland` installs deploy the same corrected Caelestia CLI toggle commands already used locally: personal opens Brave's `Default` profile and work opens `Profile 3`.

## 5.2.1 - 2026-05-20

- Add `uwsm` to `haoshoku --hyprland`'s pacman package set so manual Haoshoku Hyprland installs match CachyOS' installer profile and include the runtime needed for the `Hyprland (uwsm-managed)` SDDM session.
- Keep the `skipHyprlandPackages` path unchanged: users already running Hyprland still skip the full Hyprland package install.
- Include the existing unreleased follow-ups already on `stable`: kitty/Claude terminal theming via OSC sequences, KDE Connect autostart in both per-device Caelestia `hypr-user` variants, and the Brave personal/work profile directory mapping repair.

## 5.2.0 - 2026-05-20

- Replace v5.1.2's skip-on-laptop stopgap with a **per-device hypr-user variant router**. `configs/caelestia/hypr-user.conf` is renamed to `hypr-user-pc.conf` (existing PC content unchanged) and a new `hypr-user-laptop.conf` ships alongside it (eDP-1 @ 2880x1800@120 scale 1.6, no monitor-pinned workspaces, no NVIDIA exec-once — fits the actual single-screen Intel-iGPU laptop topology). `syncCaelestiaPrefs()` now reads `deviceType` from `~/.haoshoku.json` and routes to the matching variant, deploying it as `~/.config/caelestia/hypr-user.conf`. `backupCaelestiaPrefs()` mirrors this: snapshots from `~/.config/caelestia/hypr-user.conf` back to the variant file matching the local deviceType (so a laptop backup doesn't overwrite the PC variant).
- Variant resolution: `deviceType === "pc"` or `"laptop"` → that variant. Anything else (unset, `"other"`, malformed `~/.haoshoku.json`, missing key) → falls back to `pc` (safer default for the legacy / mainstream case). If the chosen variant file doesn't exist in the repo (e.g. deleted), `hypr-user.conf` deploy is skipped with a warning; `cli.json` still deploys.
- Update `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js` from 16 tests covering v5.1.2's skip behavior to 20 tests covering the router: both deviceType branches deploy their correct variant, four fallback paths land on PC, missing-variant skips gracefully, idempotent re-run, and static-config validation now asserts both `hypr-user-pc.conf` and `hypr-user-laptop.conf` ship with their expected shape (PC has `monitor:` pinned workspaces; laptop has eDP-1 + no monitor pins + no `nvidia-settings`).
- Update `configs/caelestia/CLAUDE.md` to document the per-device variant model and the deviceType resolution rules.

## 5.1.2 - 2026-05-20

- Fix `syncCaelestiaPrefs()` deploying the PC's `hypr-user.conf` onto laptop installs. The auto-deployed file carries machine-specific monitor lines (`DP-1`/`DP-2`/`HDMI-A-1`), workspace-to-monitor pins, and an NVIDIA `nvidia-settings GPUPowerMizerMode=1` exec-once that all fail or no-op on a single-screen laptop with an iGPU. `syncCaelestiaPrefs` now reads `deviceType` from `~/.haoshoku.json` (populated by `--hyprland`'s `promptDeviceType`) and skips machine-specific files when `deviceType === "laptop"`. `cli.json` (portable special-workspace toggle defs) deploys regardless. Missing / malformed / unset `~/.haoshoku.json` falls back to the existing "deploy everything" behavior — safer default for unknown machines.
- Add 6 regression tests in `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js` covering: laptop skips `hypr-user.conf` (the new behavior), pc deploys both files (current behavior preserved), missing `~/.haoshoku.json` deploys both, unset `deviceType` key deploys both, malformed JSON deploys both, unknown `deviceType` value (`"other"`) deploys both.
- Per-device template work is still tracked in `docs/hyprland-monitor-multihost-todo.md`; v5.1.2 is the safety patch that prevents broken first-run experience on laptops while we figure out the proper laptop template (likely v5.2.0 once the laptop install captures its topology).

## 5.1.1 - 2026-05-20

- Fix `runCachyOSSetup()` not deploying the user's saved Caelestia preferences. v5.1.0 added `--caelestia-prefs` as a standalone flag but forgot to call `configureCaelestiaPrefs()` from `configureHyprland()` in `src/os_scripts/cachyos.js`, so a fresh `haoshoku` install (no flags) booted Hyprland with upstream Caelestia defaults instead of the user's `configs/caelestia/{hypr-user.conf, cli.json}`. Now `configureHyprland()` calls `configureCaelestiaPrefs()` immediately after `installCaelestia()`, mirroring how `configureZed()` runs after its install step. Manually re-running `haoshoku --caelestia-prefs` is still supported as the explicit path.
- Add 2 regression tests in `tests/cachyos.test.js`: one asserts `configureCaelestiaPrefs` is called exactly once after `installCaelestia`, the other asserts the import line resolves to `../helpers/configure_caelestia_prefs.js`. Both follow the existing static-source-analysis pattern used for the fish/fastfetch ordering tests.

## 5.1.0 - 2026-05-20

- Add `--caelestia-prefs` and `--caelestia-prefs-backup` CLI flags for syncing personal Caelestia overrides (`hypr-user.conf`, `cli.json`) between `configs/caelestia/` and `~/.config/caelestia/`. Mirrors the `--zed` / `--zed-backup` pattern, so workspace pins, keybind rebinds, and special-workspace toggle config (the `caelestia toggle <ws>` entries used by Super+M music, Super+D communication, Super+O 1Password, Super+W/B brave-work/personal, Super+A claude, Super+H stash, etc.) are now versioned in-tree and redeployable on fresh installs. `hypr-user.conf` still carries machine-specific `monitor = ...` lines — edit those on different hardware per the new `configs/caelestia/CLAUDE.md`.
- Add `src/helpers/configure_caelestia_prefs.js` exporting `syncCaelestiaPrefs` / `backupCaelestiaPrefs` / `configureCaelestiaPrefs`. Helpers accept optional `home` / `projectRoot` so tests can inject temp dirs while production callers stay zero-arg.
- Add 10 tests in `tests/configure_caelestia_prefs.test.js` covering module shape, both sync directions, idempotency, missing-file tolerance, and static-config validation of the seeded `configs/caelestia/{hypr-user.conf, cli.json}` snapshots.

## 5.0.1 - 2026-05-20

- Make Zed follow the Caelestia desktop theme by default. `configs/zed/settings.json` now selects `Caelestia` for both light and dark modes, and Haoshoku vendors `configs/zed/themes/caelestia.json` so fresh `haoshoku --zed` installs do not depend on a pre-existing local Zed theme.
- Add regression coverage ensuring the Zed template continues to select Caelestia and the vendored theme remains parseable.
- Make `haoshoku --hyprland` explicitly set Caelestia to 24-hour time by merging `services.useTwelveHourClock: false` into `~/.config/caelestia/shell.json` while preserving existing shell settings.

## 5.0.0 - 2026-05-20

**Breaking change.** Removes the haoshoku-managed "Ocean" Hyprland overlay layer (curated borders/blur/keybinds/window-rules/autostart/hyprlock/hypridle/hyprpaper/mako) on top of upstream Caelestia. `--hyprland` now installs Caelestia + nothing else. Monitor configuration becomes the user's responsibility.

- Remove CLI subcommands `--hyprland-keybinds`, `--hyprland-rules`, `--hyprland-backup`. The functions backing them (`syncHyprlandOverlay`, `backupHyprland`, the KDE→Hyprland translators for shortcuts/window-rules/autostart, the Ocean palette parser, `kdeRgbToHyprlandRgba`, `sanitizeDesktopExec`, `ensureLineInFile`, the `OVERLAY_SOURCE_LINE` / `CAELESTIA_USER_INCLUDE` / `OCEAN_OVERLAY_DIR` / `HYPR_BUNDLE_DIR` constants) are gone with them. `src/helpers/configure_hyprland.js` shrinks from 987 LOC to ~270.
- Delete `configs/hypr/` (8 `conf.d/` files + `hyprpaper.conf` + `hyprlock.conf` + `hypridle.conf` + `mako/config`) — Caelestia's Quickshell ships its own lockscreen / idle / wallpaper / notification handling (the Quickshell daemon `qs -c caelestia -n -d` owns `org.freedesktop.Notifications` directly).
- Delete `docs/hyprland-parity-gap.md` (KDE shortcut → Hyprland bind translation tracker — no longer relevant without the translators).
- `installCaelestia` no longer writes a `source = ~/.config/hypr-ocean/conf.d/*.conf` line into `~/.config/caelestia/hypr-user.conf` and no longer creates `~/.config/hypr-ocean/`. `hypr-user.conf` is now pure user-owned space (pre-created empty so Hyprland's first `source =` doesn't error before Caelestia's lazy-init exec hook runs).
- `installCaelestia` accepts a new `skipHyprlandPackages` option to bypass the `pacman -S hyprland …` step when the caller is already running Hyprland. Also drops `mako` from `HYPRLAND_PACKAGES` (Caelestia covers notifications).
- `--hyprland` now prompts for two things up front:
  - **Current desktop environment** (auto-detected via `$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`; user can override). When the answer is `hyprland`, `installCaelestia` runs with `skipHyprlandPackages: true`.
  - **Device type** (Main PC / Laptop / Other / Skip). Non-skip answers persist to `~/.haoshoku.json` as `deviceType`, merging with any existing keys. The answer isn't consumed yet — it's the seed for future per-device monitor configuration (see `docs/hyprland-monitor-multihost-todo.md`).
- Add 20 tests in `tests/configure_hyprland.test.js` covering `installCaelestia` (happy path, `skipHyprlandPackages`, idempotent re-run, recovery, two regression guards against re-introducing Ocean), `promptDesktopEnvironment` (4 cases including cancel), `promptDeviceType` (4 cases including merge-don't-overwrite), and the existing `checkoutPinnedCaelestia` / `recoverCaelestiaPackages` paths. Full project suite drops from 80 to 38 tests — the 50+ removed tests exercised the deleted KDE translators and overlay sync.
- Update `README.md`, `docs/CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/hyprland-monitor-multihost-todo.md` to reflect the slimmed scope and the `deviceType` workflow. Refresh `cachyos.js` to stop calling `syncHyprlandOverlay()`.

**Rollback / pinning.** `npm install -g haoshoku@4.6.6` (or checkout `v4.6.6` from git) restores the Ocean overlay. No deprecation branch — the git tag is the rollback point.

**Known caveat on existing installs.** `~/.config/hypr/scheme/default.conf` may contain alpha-suffixed Caelestia color variants (`$primarye6` etc.) added during the 4.6.x color-scheme fix. They're in Caelestia's symlinked tree and Caelestia normally regenerates `current.conf` dynamically from your wallpaper — a future Caelestia update will clobber them. Not addressed by 5.0.0; flagged here for visibility.

## 4.6.6 - 2026-05-20
- Fix `translateKdeWindowRulesToHyprland` emitting deprecated `windowrulev2 =` lines. Hyprland 0.45+ renamed the keyword to `windowrule =` and changed the matcher grammar: inline `class:^(foo)$` selectors became space-separated `match:class ^foo$` after a comma, and boolean rules now require an explicit value (`float` → `float true`). Output now reads `windowrule = float true, match:class ^foo$` / `windowrule = opacity 0.90, match:class ^foo$` / `windowrule = workspace N, match:class ^foo$`. Regex metacharacters in the class name are still escaped, and explicit `^...$` anchors are kept to preserve v2's exact-class match semantics. On current Hyprland (0.55.2), the prior v2 output was both spamming `configerrors` and on track to stop applying entirely in a future release.
- Update the 6 test assertions that pinned the old syntax (including 2 in the "Adversarial coverage" block that asserted on the bare `class:^(b)$` substring), and regenerate `configs/hypr/conf.d/30-windowrules.conf` via `bun haoshoku.js --hyprland-rules`.
- Add `docs/hyprland-monitor-multihost-todo.md` capturing the deferred multi-host monitor work: today's live topology on host `io` (positions, transforms, EDIDs so it's reconstructable), already-made decisions (per-host strategy, primary monitor, vertical alignment, portrait rotation), and open questions for the next pass on `configs/hypr/conf.d/50-monitors.conf`.

## 4.6.5 - 2026-05-19
- Fix `--hyprland` Caelestia recovery when CachyOS package mirrors or sync databases are stale. If the explicit `paru -S caelestia-cli caelestia-shell` retry fails, Haoshoku now runs one CachyOS mirror refresh plus forced pacman database refresh, then retries the Caelestia leaf packages before failing.
- Add regression coverage for the mirror/database refresh retry path so the installer no longer gives up immediately on transient CachyOS `.sig` retrieval failures.

## 4.6.2 - 2026-05-19
- Fix 14 KDE→Hyprland translation bugs found via adversarial test coverage of `src/helpers/configure_hyprland.js`. Most produced malformed Hyprland directives that would cause Hyprland to silently reject the entire `conf.d/` file, dropping every keybind or rule it contained.
- Security: `checkoutPinnedCaelestia` now validates `pinnedSha` against `/^[a-f0-9]{7,40}$/i` before interpolating it into the `git checkout` command. The shared `runCommand` helper auto-routes commands containing shell metacharacters through `sh -c`, so an unvalidated SHA like `"abc; rm -rf $HOME"` would have executed shell injection.
- `kdeRgbToHyprlandRgba`: reject components outside 0–255 (e.g. `256` → `rgba(1000000ff)` 9-char body) and reject `alphaHex` that isn't exactly 2 hex chars (`"xyz"` → `rgba(000000xyz)`).
- `translateKdeWindowRulesToHyprland`: pick the second token (class) of multi-token `wmclasscomplete=true` values per KDE spec — `.pop()` was wrong for 3-token Qt app names; escape regex metacharacters in `wmclass` so `foo(bar` doesn't break Hyprland's PCRE; clamp `opacityactive` to 0–100 so `-50` / `150` no longer emit `opacity -0.50` / `opacity 1.50`.
- `sanitizeDesktopExec`: strip adjacent field codes like `%f%u` (the prior regex required whitespace boundaries and silently passed concatenated codes); broaden the Flatpak `@@<letter> … @@` wrapper match so unknown prefixes like `@@x` are also stripped; preserve `%%` literal-percent via negative lookbehind.
- `translateKdeShortcutsToHyprland`: reject empty keys (e.g. `Meta+` trailing-`+`) which otherwise emitted `bind = SUPER, , dispatcher`; dedupe modifier tokens so `Ctrl+Alt+Ctrl+X` collapses to `CTRL_ALT, X` instead of the malformed `CTRL_ALT_CTRL, X`.
- `translateKdeAutostartToHyprland`: peel known shim binaries (`env`, `dbus-run-session`, `dbus-launch`, `nohup`, `setsid`, `stdbuf`) and their flag / `NAME=VAL` args before checking the denylist. Without this, `Exec=env DISPLAY=:0 kdeconnectd` and `Exec=dbus-run-session -- kdeconnectd` bypassed the KDE-service denylist.
- `ensureLineInFile`: throw when the `line` argument contains a newline. The trim-based dedupe would always miss a multi-line input, then write the blob verbatim — silently appending extra Hyprland directives into `hypr-user.conf`.
- Add 17 new adversarial test cases (red/blue/green workflow) covering each confirmed bug surface plus positive companion tests. Total hyprland tests: 39 → 58; full project suite: 56 → 77, all green.

## 4.6.1 - 2026-05-19
- Exclude local agent/runtime state (`.claude/`, the retired orchestration state directory, `superpowers/`) and generated video output from package dry-runs/publishes.
- Fix lint-only issues in the Remotion video components so the release branch passes `bun run lint` cleanly.

## 4.6.0 - 2026-05-19
- Add `--hyprland`: bootstrap Hyprland plus upstream Caelestia rice and deploy the Ocean overlay on CachyOS/Arch. KDE Plasma remains installed as the SDDM fallback session.
- Add `--hyprland-keybinds`: regenerate `configs/hypr/conf.d/20-keybinds.conf` from `configs/kde_shortcuts.kksrc` with translated Hyprland binds.
- Add `--hyprland-rules`: regenerate `configs/hypr/conf.d/30-windowrules.conf` and `40-autostart.conf` from live KDE config with KDE-only autostart services denylisted.
- Add `--hyprland-backup`: pull live `~/.config/hypr-ocean/` and `~/.config/mako/` overlay state back into `configs/hypr/`.
- Bundle the Ocean Hyprland overlay: Ocean borders, KDE Glass-style blur, Wayland env, keybind/rule/autostart translations, hyprpaper, hyprlock, hypridle, mako, and a safe monitor fallback.

## 4.5.0 - 2026-05-14
- Fix `--claude` aborting before deploying any config on a fresh install. When the cache was empty, the auto-skill-sync was treating an empty `skillSources` array as "all sources failed" and calling `process.exit(1)` — so `syncClaudeConfig()` never ran and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh`, and `~/.claude.json` all silently failed to deploy.
- `syncSkills` now returns `{ status, merged }` (one of `"ok" | "no-sources" | "all-failed"`) instead of calling `process.exit`. The `--claude` and `--claude-update` paths treat non-`ok` as a warning and continue with the config deploy; `--skills` and `--skills-update` translate `"all-failed"` into a non-zero exit code, preserving direct-CLI exit semantics.
- `syncClaudeConfig` no longer silently skips when a source file is missing from the bundle — it now logs `⚠ Missing <file> in source bundle — skipped` so a partial/broken package is visible instead of looking like a successful sync. Added regression tests for the `PERSONAL_FILES` manifest (must include `statusline-command.sh`) and the missing-source warning.
- Inject `srcDir`/`claudeHome` options into `syncClaudeConfig`/`backupClaudeConfig` and `configPath`/`cacheDir` into `syncSkills` (defaults unchanged) so tests can drive them against tmp dirs without touching live `~/.claude/`.

## 4.4.0 - 2026-05-14
- Sync personal Claude config snapshot (`settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `claude.json` runtime state, `statusline-command.sh`) from live `~/.claude/`.
- CLAUDE.md: add a `## PR Reviews` routing section codifying the local-markdown-as-deliverable workflow — never auto-post; explicit per-session approval required; medium-shape format (verdict + severity table + condensed strengths + per-finding paragraphs) when posting to GitHub; verbatim code-block fixes go inline rather than expanding the body; `~/defi/misc/reviews/review-PR-<num>.md` is the canonical defi-com path.
- settings.json: migrate effort selection from top-level `effortLevel: "xhigh"` to env-driven `env.CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL: "max"`; drop the disabled `openai-codex` plugin (entry + source); add `editorMode: "normal"`.
- statusline: render the new `max` effort tier with a per-character green → cyan → purple Dracula gradient (`#50FA7B` → `#8BE9FD` → `#BD93F9`). Refactor the effort branch to compose a full pre-colored token (`eff_render`) instead of computing only a color, which is what unlocks per-character rainbow rendering.

## 4.3.0 - 2026-05-11
- Replace `--gsd` with `--superpowers`. The new flag idempotently enables the Superpowers plugin via a direct edit to `~/.claude/settings.json` (different shape from `--gsd`'s npx shell-out).
- Remove dead `gsd-*` agent emoji entries from the Claude Code statusline (live + backed-up copy).
- Update README, helpers README, and configs/claude/README to reflect the migration.

## 4.2.1 - 2026-05-10
- Add reasoning effort indicator to Claude Code statusline (`💭 <level>` color-coded by tier — dim/blue/green/magenta for low/medium/high/xhigh; shows `⚡ fast` when fast mode bypasses thinking).
- Sync personal Claude config snapshot (`settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `claude.json` runtime state) from live `~/.claude/`. CLAUDE.md transitions from GSD-era routing to Superpowers framework.

## 4.2.0 - 2026-04-28
- Remove Ghostty integration end-to-end (config templates, `--ghostty-theme` flag, per-OS deploy block). Kitty replaces it as the default terminal.
- Port deep-ocean theme to Kitty (palette, 0xProto Nerd Font Mono, opacity 0.85, KDE-honored `background_blur`, shift+enter Claude Code newline keybind).
- Backup before overwrite for fish, kitty, and alacritty configs (closes ROB-02). Existing configs are preserved as `<dest>.bak` on each deploy. Single rolling backup matches the existing KDE-shortcuts pattern.
- Add `safeCopyFile` helper to `common/utils.js` with three test specs.

## 4.1.1 - 2026-04-17

- Add skill management documentation.
- Prompt to sync skills after OS setup.
- Track shared skill resources independently.
- Remove skills from submodule symlinks (use runtime git clone).
